A simple plugin that adds two shortcodes: [logged_in] and [logged_out]. Anything inside [logged_in] will only be displayed if the user is logged in, and anything inside [logged_out] will only be displayed if you're logged out. If you want to specify that users of a certain role can see certain content, use the 'roles' option. By default, admin roles see everything, though you can deactivate that by setting the 'hide_for_admin' option to any truth-like value ("true", "yes", "on", or "1")
